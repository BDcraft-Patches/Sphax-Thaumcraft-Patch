FILE SPECIFIC:

gui_arcaneworkbench       - simplify the main box, make it look more like guiresearchtable2

gui_researchback_eldritch - make it vector and Sphaxy (will be hard though)
gui_researchbook          - some small tweaks to make it fit in better, also ask Azanor about the
                            font used in the research book (would love to change the default one)

guigolem                  - needs an update (take buttons from guiresearchtable2), possibly some 
                            other minor changes
hud                       - a lot is added, update ...
